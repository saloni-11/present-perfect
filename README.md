# PresentPerfect

A web app that analyzes video and audio recordings of presentations and gives scored, written feedback on delivery.

**People's Choice Award — UTS Tech Festival AI Showcase 2025**

---

## What it does

Upload a video (`.mp4`) or audio recording (`.mp3`, `.wav`) of yourself presenting. The app processes the file and returns **scores out of 100** and written coaching feedback across six dimensions:

| Dimension | What it measures |
|---|---|
| Facial expression | Whether your emotion matches what you're saying, per segment |
| Gaze | Where you're looking throughout (left, right, center, up, down) |
| Stage movement | How you use horizontal space in the frame |
| Shoulder posture | Whether your shoulders stay level |
| Hand gestures | Whether your hands are active or idle |
| Speech | Word choice, structure, pacing, filler word use |

**Audio-only uploads** get a subset: the app transcribes the recording, scores speech quality, rewrites the script to remove filler words and improve structure, and generates a text-to-speech version via AWS Polly.

## The problem it addresses

Most people improving their presentation skills either practice alone with no feedback, or pay for a speaking coach. This app gives automated, signal-based feedback specific enough to be actionable — it tells you *which seconds* you looked away, *when* your shoulders dropped, and whether your speaking pace was appropriate for audience comprehension.

### Video path (`/api/analyze`)

1. Whisper starts transcribing in a background thread while frame analysis runs concurrently.
2. A producer thread reads frames and samples every 8th frame into a bounded queue.
3. Consumer threads pull batches and run **three detectors in parallel** per batch via `ThreadPoolExecutor`:
   - **Emotion** — MediaPipe FaceDetection crops the face → custom YOLO model classifies among 8 AffectNet emotion classes
   - **Gaze** — MediaPipe FaceMesh extracts 6 face landmarks → OpenCV `solvePnP` estimates head pose → yaw/pitch mapped to direction label
   - **Posture / movement / gesture** — MediaPipe Pose extracts body landmarks → shoulder angle, shoulder midpoint position, wrist-to-hip distance
4. Socket.IO emits progress events ~once per second.
5. Per-second signals are aggregated to their dominant value.
6. GPT-4.1 receives the full analytics timeline + timestamped transcript → returns a `PresentationFeedback` object with six integer scores and text explanations.

### Audio path (`/api/analyze-audio`)

1. Whisper transcribes the recording.
2. Speech metrics extracted (WPM, filler word ratio, pause analysis).
3. GPT-4o-mini analyzes for clarity, pace, confidence, engagement.
4. GPT-4o-mini rewrites the transcript (removes fillers, fixes structure, adds transitions).
5. AWS Polly synthesizes the rewritten script to MP3.
6. Frontend receives scores, both transcripts, and a playable URL.

### Report output

The frontend displays: scores as a radar chart, per-second gaze as a directional heatmap grid, shoulder and gesture breakdowns as pie charts, movement across time as a line chart, emotion mapped per transcript segment, and full written feedback. Exportable as PNG.

## How to run locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- **GPU strongly recommended** — CUDA-capable for video processing. Falls back to CPU but significantly slower.
- OpenAI API key (required for feedback generation)
- AWS credentials with Polly access (required only for audio mode)

### Backend

```bash
cd webapi
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install boto3  # required for audio mode; not yet in requirements.txt
```

Create `webapi/.env`:

```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Path to trained emotion detection model weights
# Without this, the app falls back to a generic yolov8n.pt (auto-downloaded)
# which does NOT classify facial expressions — emotion scores won't work.
MODEL_PATH=path/to/affectnet_model.pt

# Optional: Azure OpenAI instead of OpenAI
USE_AZURE_OPENAI=false
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Required for audio mode (AWS Polly TTS)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
```

```bash
python app.py
# Backend runs on http://localhost:4000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm start
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
```

> **Note:** The backend URL (`http://localhost:4000`) is hardcoded in `webapp/src/pages/UploadPage.js` — update if deploying elsewhere.

### Model weights

The trained `.pt` files are **not included** in this repository. The `models/` directory contains training metrics, performance curves, and confusion matrices, but not the weights. Contact the contributors to request the model files.

The posture and pose tracking module uses MediaPipe Pose to extract body landmarks from each sampled video frame. Three separate signals are computed, all in the `movement_batch()` function in `webapi/app.py`:

**Shoulder tilt detection** — Calculates the angle between left and right shoulder landmarks using `atan2`. Frames where the angle exceeds 7° → "Shoulders Tilted"; below that → "Shoulders Straight." Prototype: `Salmons workspace/posture_test1.py`.

**Hand gesture detection** — Measures the Euclidean distance between each wrist landmark and the midpoint of both hip landmarks. If either hand is >22% of the normalised frame width from the hip midpoint → "Gesturing"; otherwise → "Idle Hands."

**Horizontal stage movement** *(shared with Jonathan's prototype)* — Tracks the shoulder midpoint across the frame width, normalised to [0, 1], then binned into a 1–10 position scale. The LLM uses this per-second timeline to assess stage usage.

Together these three signals account for **three of the six scored output dimensions** (shoulder, hands, movement).

**AffectNet dataset sourcing** — The emotion model was trained on AffectNet (8 classes: Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise). Sourcing and preparing this dataset for the YOLO training format was part of this contribution. Dataset config: `Kavi's Workspace/data.yaml`; training artifacts in `models/`.
